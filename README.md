## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have these installed:

#### 1. Git
```bash
# Windows (using Chocolatey)
choco install git

# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install git

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install git

# Verify installation
git --version
```

#### 2. Python 3.8+
```bash
# Windows: Download from python.org
# Or using Chocolatey
choco install python

# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install python

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip

# Verify installation
python --version
# or
python3 --version
```

#### 3. Node.js (for Mermaid diagram support)
```bash
# Windows (using Chocolatey)
choco install nodejs

# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install node

# Ubuntu/Debian
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Verify installation
node --version
npm --version
```

#### 4. Claude Code
```bash
# Install Claude Code CLI
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Or download from: https://claude.ai/code
# Follow the installation guide for your platform

# Verify installation
claude --version

# Login to Claude Code
claude auth login
```

### Installation

**Install the 12 agents as native Claude Code subagents.** Easiest is the plugin marketplace
(this repo *is* the marketplace):

```
/plugin marketplace add thomasphillips3/gamestudio-subagents
/plugin install gamestudio-subagents@gamestudio
```

…or copy them into your agents folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thomasphillips3/gamestudio-subagents.git
cd gamestudio-subagents
./install.sh            # -> ~/.claude/agents/   (Windows: ./install.ps1)
```

Restart Claude Code and run `/agents` to confirm the `gamestudio-*` agents are listed.
See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for every option (project scope, local plugin dev, etc.).

**Use the team** — let automatic delegation route work, or invoke an agent explicitly:

```
Use the gamestudio-orchestrator agent to start a new game project.
```

…or run the bundled command, which interviews you and chains the specialists in order:

```
/new-game a cozy farming roguelike
```

**Optional — scaffold a project workspace** (folders + `project-config.json`):

```bash
python3 scripts/init_project.py      # creates projects/[your-game-name]/
python3 scripts/project_manager.py   # manage existing projects
```

That's it! Your AI game development team is ready to help.

## 📚 How It Works

### 1. Project Initialization
The system starts with market validation, then project setup:
- **Market Analysis**: Competitive research and opportunity assessment
- **Project Setup**: Organized folders and agent configuration  
- **Documentation**: Templates and milestone schedules
- **Analytics Setup**: Telemetry and metrics planning

### 1.5. Development Rules Configuration
During initialization, you can define custom development rules:
- **Coding Standards**: Clean Code, SOLID, DRY, KISS principles
- **Architecture Patterns**: MVC, ECS, State Machines, etc.
- **Performance Requirements**: FPS targets, memory limits
- **Project-Specific Rules**: Any custom standards for your team

All rules are stored in `project-config.json` and enforced by the Producer Agent throughout development.

### 2. Development Modes

#### 🎨 Design Mode
Perfect for exploring ideas without committing to development:
- **Market Validation**: Competitive analysis and target audience research
- **Design Documentation**: Complete game design with data backing

- **Rapid Prototyping**: Core mechanics with telemetry
- **Data Collection**: Player behavior and engagement metrics
- **Performance Validation**: Technical and market viability

#### 🎮 Development Mode
Full production pipeline with all agents:
- **Data-Driven Development**: Analytics throughout production
- **Market-Aware Implementation**: Features based on competitive research
- **Continuous Optimization**: A/B testing and performance monitoring
- **Quality Assurance**: QA with telemetry integration

### 3. Agent Coordination
Agents communicate through structured protocols:
```
User → Master Orchestrator → Market Analysis → Producer → Specialized Agents → Data Collection → Optimization
```
